# Cloud Inquisitor is Under Construction

Cloud Inquisitor is currently undergoing a refresh to embrace newer cloud-native technologies while also realigning on its core vision.

You can follow our work in the branch `cinq_next_master`.

The project will no longer accept external PRs against the code base and will be grooming and closing any issues we do not believe will be pertanent to Cloud Inquisitors new alignment.

However, we will still accept feature requests in the form of an issue but will prioritize the replacement of target features within Cloud Inquisitor over new features.

# Phase 1

Re-implement tag auditing.

Re-implement domain hijacking identification.

# Cloud Inquisitor Architecture

Cloud Inquisitor is designed to be a per-environment/localized deployment. For instance, in the case of running Cloud Inquisitor in AWS in any given account, Cloud Inquisitor will be deployed in every region where the auditing and mitigations efforts should take place. This allows each region to run its own workflows based on which resources are running in those region (e.g. IAM always runs out of us-east-1 and Route53 runs always runs out of us-west-1).

A Cloud Inquisitor workflow is a set of rules/conditions that, when triggered, will start the auditing and mitigation process which could be as simple as running a simple AWS Lambda or something more involved such as a multi-stage AWS Step Function which will run for weeks.

## Workflows

Workflows pair environment triggers with remediation actions. 

Current supported triggers are:

  - Cloudwatch Events

Current supported remediation actions are:

  - Invoke Step Functions


Example usage of terraform module:

```terraform
locals {
  ec2_rule = <<RuleOne
      {
          "source": [
              "aws.ec2"
          ],
          "detail-type": [
              "AWS API Call via CloudTrail"
          ],
          "detail": {
              "eventSource": [
                  "ec2.amazonaws.com"
              ],
              "eventName": [
                  "ModifyInstanceAttribute",
                  "RunInstances",
                  "StartInstances",
                  "StopInstances",
                  "TerminateInstances"
              ]
          }
      } 
  RuleOne
}

module "us-west-2" {
    source = "./terraform_modules/workflow"

    name = "cinq_next_test"
    environment = "dev"
    region = "us-west-2"
    version_str = "v0_0_0"


    event_rules = { 
        "ec2_tag_auditing":  local.ec2_rule
    }

    step_function_selector = "hello_world"
}
```

This configuration allows a map of Cloudwatch Event rules (and a label to give them) to be provisioned by the module and configure the Cloudwatch Event target 
 to be the selected.

### Environment Triggers

#### Cloudwatch Event Rules

AWS Cloudwatch Events (soon to be Event Bus) allows certain API calls to be trapped and trigger another AWS resource. These rules can be grouped together to trigger the same AWS resource.

### Remediation Actions

#### Invoke Step Functions

AWS Step Functions allow for a state machine to be used to monitor and remediate resources. All Step Functions that can be used are predefined and can be seelcted by providing the `step_function_selector` in the workflow module declaration.

Current Step Functions include:

  - _Hello World ("hello_world:)_

    The Hello World Step Function is a two stage state machine that prints out "hello" and "world". This is an easy to use function for ensuring event triggers are working properly.
